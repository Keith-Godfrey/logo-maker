# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This is an application where you can make your own logo instead of paying a graphic designer. The user can input up to three text characters, enter the color of the text they want, select a shape (circle, square or triangle), and then input the color of the shape.  Then a SVG logo will be created.

## Installation
To install the SVG Logo-Maker git clone the repository onto a local environment and run the command "npm i" in the terminal. Then run the command "node index.js" and answer the prompts as they appear in the terminal.

## Testing 
Here is a screenshot of the Jest test.
